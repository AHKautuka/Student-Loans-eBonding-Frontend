## Problem Definition
Every academic year, needy students in different accredited universities and colleges apply for loans from the Loans Board. The Board processes these applications and releases a list of successful students from each university and college. Following this process, successful students undergo a bonding process. Assuming this process is carried out manually, as the student population increases, manually processing student bonding forms becomes quite involving for both students and Loans Board officials.

Develop a software application that automates the student bonding process.
- As a requirement, the system should be seamless to use on both mobile and web-based platforms. A similar user experience should be afforded on all platforms where the system will be accessed.
